tatoeba-android
===============

Android mobile client for tatoeba.org
An early draft.


#TODO:
* In the "Browse" section move the "random" UI block to the top, it seems to be more important.
* Re-work the "Search" fragment, try to use RelativeLayout instead of what's there now :)
* Don't show all the complete translations in the "Results". Display either only flags for the translations or the translations, shortened to one line.
* Display flags for languages instead of the codes.
* Slide left/right in the detailed sentence activity to move to a previous/next one.
* Slide left/right in the results fragment to move between the pages.
